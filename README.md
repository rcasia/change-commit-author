If you've mistakenly made a commit using the wrong author information, don't worry! This is a common issue, but fortunately, there's an easy solution.


## Overview

This script replaces the author information for a given commit, allowing you to correct any mistakes that were made. For example, if you made a commit with your enterprise account instead of your personal one, you can use this script to update the author information.


## How to Use the Script

```
2. Make sure you have a backup of your repository in case something goes wrong.


That's it! Once you've downloaded the script and created a backup of your repository, you can run the script to update the author information for any commit.

By following these steps, you can quickly and easily correct any mistakes that were made and ensure that your commit history is accurate and up-to-date.
